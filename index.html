          <h1>My Story</h1>
          <p>If your reading my story, then you might be a survivor of your own Domestic Violence. I thought I had the perfect family, perfect relationship. I never thought as the years went by that I was a victim of Domestic Violence. The arguing woud get more intense and the abuse would get more physical. I know I wont be the only woman to say that when my husband and I had great days, he would make me feel like his queen and he my king. Like I was the only woman he'd ever have eyes for and truly love. But when we had our bad days, they would go from bad to worst. I knew deep down my husband loved me but i also knew this couldn't be real love because love isn't supposed to hurt. Not me, not him not anyone! But for some reason it did hurt during those 9 years we shared together. The cheating, the lies, the fights, the control he had over me, the fear that was created inside me.  We shared alot of great loving memories but because of all the fighting and physical abuse with each other, the bad memories take over the good ones and replay in my head over and over again. Every time he swung his fist into my body it was always an "Im sorry babe, Please forgive me" right after. He would always bring my self esteem to the ground and always reminded me that No man would ever love me the way he did and thats why he treated me the way he did. As I started to believe his lies and had our first born son. I began to realize that i didnt want our son to grow up seeing his mother get beat physically nor be verbally abused by his loving father. My husband was a great father to his son. But an abusive man to me. I'm proud to say today "I Survived Domestic Violence"      </p>
